# Security

This is a guide on how Provisioner handles security.

> Who can use this feature?
> Administrators who are deploying phones hooked up to our provisioning service.

## Intro

The idea and goal of security is to work completely in the background without it changing too much of the current behavior. We also wanted a single method that could work across all brands and models. This way we remove the complexity of customizing authentication per brand/model which could introduce more errors on top of making it more difficult to manage.

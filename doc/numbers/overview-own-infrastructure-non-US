The monster numbers app does not handle international phonenumbers, not even if your provider does.
I am not sure if the erlang code for various did providers can handle it, as it was never the intention at the start.

However, since Kazoo is being used all over the globe now, i can imagine there is a solution, but its just not shared at the moment.

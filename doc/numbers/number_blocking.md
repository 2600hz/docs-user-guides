## Blacklist Management

Blacklist Manager is found in Callflows app, Blacklist.
You can have multiple named blacklists that can be enabled or disabled on an account.

###Create a blacklist.
   1. Click Add.
   2. Give the Blacklist a name
   3. Click Add Number
   4. Add the number desired to be blocked. Format it the way it appears in the Call Log detail, caller_id_number field. (not the way it is displayed in the summary table)

###Block Anonymous Calls
Anonymous calls can be represented many ways in calls. We cannot anticipate all ways but most we can identify and you can block by adding the number "0000000000", (10 zeros) without quotes, as the number to block. 

## Active Blacklists

Managing what blacklists are active is done from Callflows app, Account Settings, Blacklists (near bottom of page).
After creating a blacklist, it then must be moved to the "Selected" group for it to be active.
Don't forget to Update/save.

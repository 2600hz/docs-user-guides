# Adding Per Minute Services and Trunking

Create and set limits for users that include inbound and outbound trunks, and per minute credits.

2600Hz allows you to bill your users for both trunks and per-minute credits at once.

So if users exceed the number of trunks they are allocated, you can add per-minute credits.


## Per-Minute Services

Per-minute services require you to deposit money into the account before you start making calls.

To add credit to your account, click "Per Minute" just left of the main dashboard.

Then Add Credit (must be a minimum of $5).

## SIP Trunks

SIP Trunks are flat-rate channels that allow for inbound and outbound calling.

When you are within Settings, you can locate Trunking just left of the dashboard.

You have three trunking options:
    * __Outbound__: the number of concurrent outbound calls you can make at once.
    * __Inbound__ â€“ the number of concurrent inbound calls that can be made at once.
    * __Two-Way__ - the number of concurrent inbound and outbound calls that can be made at once.


## Billing

Once SIP trunks are set up, users will be billed on a recurring monthly basis and can be seen in the Service Plan within Settings.

Per-Minute Billing will be ongoing until it runs out, then it will need to be recharged.

Auto-recharge is available.

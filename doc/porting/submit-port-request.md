## What You Should Know

Here's some terminology you may encounter while submitting a port request:

| --- | --- |
| LOA | The LOA (Letter Of Authorization) is used when porting regular telephone numbers. |
| RespOrg | The RespOrg (Responsible Organization) is used when porting Toll-free numbers. |

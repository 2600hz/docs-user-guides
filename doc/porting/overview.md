## What You Should Know

Here's some terminology you might encounter while using the Port Manager application:

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| LoA | The LOA (Letter Of Authorization) is used when porting regular telephone numbers. |
| RespOrg | The RespOrg (Responsible Organization) is used when porting Toll-free numbers. |

>> Keep in Mind: Porting a number from an outside carrier is at the discretion of the carrier which you are porting the number from. 



## Important Information
Your Port Request may be granted or rejected based on the losing or gaining carrier. 

While you are able to request a date in your Port Request, it is not guaranteed. Port dates are at the discretion of carriers and tend to happen during their local business hours.

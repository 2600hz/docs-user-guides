## What You Should Know

The following items are all considered pay-per-use services:

| Service Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DNS | You'll need to be familiar with setting up DNS records and accessing your DNS service provider's configuration page |
| Email Templates | You'll need to be familiar with how to use HTML and Text emails |

>> Keep in Mind: You can white-label or brand multiple websites for multiple companies, but it will get complex remembering all the settings you've setup. We recommend one brand per reseller/customer.
